Hello! My name is Curtis and I'm a software engineer. I have a background in manufacturing project management and a passion for systems. This evolved into a desire to build amazing products in the digital world. I take inspiration from nature to develop elegant, efficient and resilient systems. My goal is to work with teams of diverse, passionate people making positive impacts on our environment/community.
